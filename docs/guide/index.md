# Introduction

Welcome to **enjoy** - where the repository is the game.

## What is enjoy?

**enjoy** is an experimental game played entirely through GitHub Pull Requests. There's no app to download, no account to create, no installation required. Just fork, code, and play.

Every PR you submit can change the game. Every contribution unlocks new possibilities. The game evolves as the community plays it.

## The Concept

> "What if a GitHub repo was a living, breathing game world?"

That's the question that sparked **enjoy**. 

The game starts as a simple static image - a void where words float in darkness. But as players contribute and the community grows, new capabilities unlock:

- **Level 1:** GitHub Pages activates. HTML contributions become possible.
- **Level 2:** CSS unlocks. The void explodes with color.
- **Level 3:** JavaScript awakens. The board becomes interactive.
- **Level 4:** Canvas drawing unlocks. Collaborative pixel art emerges.
- **Level 5:** ???

Each level fundamentally transforms what the game is and what players can create.

## Why?

**enjoy** is an experiment in:

### 🎮 Collective Creativity

No single person controls the game. Every player contributes to its evolution. The final form is unknowable - it emerges from the collective.

### 🔓 Progressive Enhancement

The game reveals itself gradually. Start simple, unlock complexity. This creates natural onboarding and maintains novelty.

### 🎨 Constraint-Driven Art

Limitations spark creativity. The CGA 16-color palette, validation rules, and sandbox constraints aren't restrictions - they're creative fuel.

### 🌐 Radical Transparency

Everything is public. The game state, the code, the rules. You can fork it, study it, remix it. The game belongs to everyone who plays it.

### 🚀 Evolution

The game has no "done" state. It keeps evolving, surprising, delighting. What starts as an image becomes... who knows?

## How Does It Work?

1. **You fork the repo**
2. **You add your contribution** (a word, HTML, CSS, JS, pixels...)
3. **You open a PR**
4. **GitHub Actions validates your contribution** against current level rules
5. **If valid, your PR auto-merges**
6. **The game state updates**
7. **The board reflects your contribution**

It's that simple. Code is the interface. PRs are the controller. The repo is the game world.

## Who Is This For?

- **Coders** who want to play with code
- **Artists** who want to paint with constraints
- **Experimenters** who love collaborative projects
- **Community builders** who believe in collective creation
- **Anyone** curious about what happens when a repo becomes a game
