  announcement: |
    The board is no longer just an image.
    It's a living webpage.
    
    You can now add HTML elements.
    Structure. Hierarchy. Meaning.
    
    But it's gray. Lifeless. Waiting for color...

flavor_text: |
  The screenshot fades. In its place: a webpage.
  You can see it live at https://[username].github.io/enjoy
  
  Your HTML is validated, sanitized, and woven into the fabric.
  But without CSS, it's just... text.
  
  Keep playing. Color is coming.
