  announcement: |
    The void fills with color.
    16 sacred hues from the CGA gods.
    
    You can now style the board.
    Make it glitch. Make it dance. Make it yours.
    
    But it's still frozen. Static. Waiting...

achievement: "style_master"

flavor_text: |
  CSS awakens. The board transforms.
  Every PR can now add style rules.
  
  Respect the palette. The 16 colors are law.
  Anything else will be rejected.
  
  Animations are allowed. Transitions are welcomed.
  Make the board pulse with life.
  
  But you can't interact. Not yet.
  Keep playing. Interactivity is coming.
