# Placeholder directories for player contributions

These directories will fill up as players contribute at different levels:

- `html/` - HTML contributions (Level 1+)
- `css/` - CSS contributions (Level 2+)
- `js/` - JavaScript contributions (Level 3+)
- `canvas/` - Canvas/pixel art contributions (Level 4+)

Each contribution is saved as a separate file named after the PR that added it.
