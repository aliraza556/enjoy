# enjoy - Development Summary

## 🎮 What We Built

A GitHub-based game with:
- **100 levels** of progression (1 → 100)
- **Karma system** (good → amplify x2-3, bad → refuse)
- **Voting system** (top coders propose rules, community votes)
- **GitHub Pages as final boss** (level 95)
- **Community governance** (level 100 = max, infinite mode)

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. 100-Level System
- Granular progression (not 5 big levels, but 100 micro-levels)
- Milestones at 10, 25, 50, 75, 95, 100
- GitHub Pages unlocks at level 95 (not level 1!)
- Community governance at level 100

### 2. Karma System (`engine/src/karma.ts`)
- **Quality analysis** of each contribution
- **Score 0-100** based on:
  - Word length (5-10 optimal)
  - Creativity (not "test", "hello", etc.)
  - Pattern quality
  - No duplicates
  - Commit message quality
- **Amplification**:
  - Excellent (80+) → x3 amplification + 25 karma
  - Good (60-79) → x2 amplification + 15 karma
  - Okay (40-59) → x1 + 5 karma
  - Bad (<40) → REFUSED + -20 karma
- **Global karma** affects multipliers
- **Player reputation** tracked separately

### 3. Voting System (`engine/src/voting.ts`)
- **Rule proposals** by top coders (or high-karma players)
- **Voting power** based on:
  - Top 10 = 1-10 votes
  - Others = 0-5 votes based on reputation
- **Approval**: 66% yes + min 20 voting power
- **7-day voting period**
- **Auto-implementation** of approved rules

### 4. Security
- HTML sanitization (DOMPurify) - TODO: implement
- CSS validation (CGA palette only) - TODO: implement
- JS sandboxing (AST validation) - TODO: implement
- Rate limiting
- Manual approval gate for level 95

### 5. Anti-Ban Strategy
- Level 1-20 are SUPER safe (just text files)
- No spam possible (karma system refuses low quality)
- Self-regulating community
- Gradual complexity increase

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (To Launch)
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd engine && npm install
   cd ../board && npm install
   cd ../docs && npm install
   ```

2. **Build engine**:
   ```bash
   cd engine && npm run build
   ```

3. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   cd engine
   echo "PHOENIX" > ../phoenix.txt
   npm run validate -- --pr-number=1
   npm run apply-effect -- --pr-number=1
   ```

4. **Generate initial screenshot**:
   ```bash
   cd board && npm run render
   ```

5. **Setup GitHub**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Enable GitHub Actions
   - Configure self-hosted runner (for screenshots)
   - Enable GitHub Pages (but set to level 95 requirement)

### Short Term (Week 1)
- Create levels 2-20 (safe foundation)
- Test karma amplification
- Invite first contributors
- Monitor for spam/abuse

### Medium Term (Month 1)
- Create levels 21-50
- First rule proposals from community
- First voting rounds
- Refine karma algorithm

### Long Term (Year 1)
- Reach level 95
- GitHub Pages activation
- Level 100 transcendence
- Full community governance

## 🎯 Philosophy

> **Execution first. Perfection later.**

The game is designed to:
1. Start SAFE (no way GitHub bans us)
2. Self-regulate (karma system prevents spam)
3. Reward quality (amplification for good work)
4. Empower community (voting on rules)
5. Build to crescendo (level 95 = Pages unlock)
6. Never truly end (level 100 = infinite mode)

## 🔥 Why This Will Work

1. **Progressive disclosure**: Game reveals itself slowly
2. **Immediate feedback**: Karma system tells you why
3. **Power fantasy**: Amplification feels AMAZING
4. **Community ownership**: Players literally vote on rules
5. **Viral moment**: Level 95 Pages unlock will be HUGE
6. **No endpoint**: Level 100 isn't the end, it's the beginning

## 📝 Notes

- **Repo owner maintains veto** (your repo, your rules)
- **Forks welcome** (they can evolve differently)
- **GitHub won't ban** (we start safe, stay safe)
- **Community will self-police** (karma + voting)
- **This is an art project** (disguised as a game)

**The repo is the game.**  
**The game is 100 levels.**  
**Let's fucking GO.** 🚀
